### Calling open reading frames (ORF)
We relied heavily on the already published [long-read proteogenomics (LRP) pipeline](https://github.com/sheynkman-lab/Long-Read-Proteogenomics) (with some modifications explained in the associated R code (Step7)

1. cpat_step (LRP)
```shell
```
2. orf_calling (LRP)
```shell
```
3. refinement (LRP)
