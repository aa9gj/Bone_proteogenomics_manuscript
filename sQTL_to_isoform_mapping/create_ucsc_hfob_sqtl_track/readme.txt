230301

Gloria Sheynkman and Arby Abood creating a UCSC browser track that would display all the hFOB transcript/protein isoforms as well as a track of the colocalized sQTLs.

Track elements:

GENCODE
Downloaded GENCODE comprehensive GTF version 38: https://www.gencodegenes.org/human/release_38.html

hFOB transcriptome/proteome
Received GTF of the hFOB CDS from Arby 230301.
`CDS.gtf` File contains 2045 isoforms from 445 genes, in which there is an isoform of that gene with an exact match to a colocalizing sQTL.

colocalized sQTLs
BED file that Arby derived that contains a list of junction coordinates from colocalization analysis of BMD GWAS against 49 GTEX sQTLs. This file has annotations in terms of source tissue/coloc. probability, etc.
