### Where do I get these files to run this code? 

1. Download the following files from the Zenodo repo (event_with_effect_size; SNP_bed/chr22; chr22_sqtl_and_ld_df, SQANTI3_results_full_corrected_chr_only.gtf)
2. Download GENCODE v26 from GENCODE (Needed for GTEx data, please refer to [GTEx FAQ](https://www.gtexportal.org/home/faq#geneModel)
3. Download hg38ToHg19.over.chain from UCSC

### Generating this data takes a long time, so you can skip generating the data yourself and download *chr_sqtl_ld.zip* file on Zenodo
